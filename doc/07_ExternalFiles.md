## Reading and Writing External Files

SAS Software has many functions to be able to read and write to external file structures.  Due to its origins on MVS mainframes, it has the ability to read data from that environment, through to many other file structures from the various environments it supports.

Python and R also have libraries to be able to read a wide variety of file formats.
