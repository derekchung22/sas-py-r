# Python and R for SAS Developers

## Statistics

Python and R include many libraries for statistical analysis.  This also includes access to recent developments which may take a while to be included in SAS products (eg: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) support).


## Python

Useful libraries include:

- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - tools for data mining and data analysis built on NumPy and SciPy.
- [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/) - fundamental package for scientific computing.
- [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) - advanced package for mathematics, science, and engineering.
- [Keras](https://keras.io/) - high-level neural networks API running on top of either TensorFlow or Theano.
- [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) - natural language toolkit.


## R

Useful libraries include:

- [caret](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html) - classification and regression training.
- [tensorflow](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tensorflow/index.html) - tensorflow access library.  Note that Tensorflow itself [supports different languages](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/), however R is not part of the core development.
